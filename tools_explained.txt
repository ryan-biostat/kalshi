# My Kalshi Tools - Function Guide

This file explains the purpose and usage of each custom function in `my_kalshi_tools.py`.

## 1. get_initialized_client()
- **Purpose:** Handles all the setup required to talk to Kalshi. It loads your API credentials from the hidden `.env` file and uses your private RSA key to authenticate.
- **Returns:** An authenticated `KalshiHttpClient` object.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  client = get_initialized_client()
  ```

## 2. find_game_in_series(client, series_ticker, search_terms)
- **Purpose:** A helper function used to search for specific markets within a larger Series.
- **How it works:** It paginates through all markets in a series (like `KXNBAGAME`) and returns only those whose **Ticker** contains *all* the provided search terms.
- **Arguments:**
  - `series_ticker`: The ID of the series (e.g., `"KXNCAAMBGAME"`).
  - `search_terms`: A list of strings to look for (e.g., `["WIS", "PSU"]`).
- **Returns:** A list of matching ticker strings.

## 3. get_market_odds(client, ticker)
- **Purpose:** Fetches and prints the standard "Yes" price and volume for a single market.
- **Output:** A clean summary showing the Market Title, Ticker, Yes Price, and Total Volume.
- **Usage:**
  ```python
  get_market_odds(client, "KXNBAGAME-26JAN21OKCMIL-OKC")
  ```

## 4. get_binary_outcomes(client, series_ticker, team1, team2)
- **Purpose:** The "Head-to-Head" tool. Finds a specific game between two teams and prints the odds for both sides.
- **When to use:** For regular season games in sports (NBA, NCAA, MLB, etc.).
- **Arguments:**
  - `team1`, `team2`: Abbreviations or names of the teams (e.g., `"LAL"`, `"BOS"`).

  get_binary_outcomes(client, "KXNBAGAME", "LAL", "BOS")
  ```

## 5. get_series_outcomes(client, series_ticker, filter_extremes=True)
- **Purpose:** The "Futures" tool. Lists all possible winners for a Championship or complex event, sorted by probability.
- **When to use:** For events with many outcomes, like "Super Bowl Winner", "Next President", or "Who will Trump meet?".
- **Features:**
  - Automatically sorts favorites to the top.
  - `filter_extremes=True`: Hides outcomes with <1% or >99% probability to reduce noise.
- **Example:**
  ```python
  get_series_outcomes(client, "KXNFLNFCCHAMP")
  ```

## 6. get_market_probability(client, ticker)
- **Purpose:** The "Drill Down" tool. Gives the exact "Yes" AND "No" prices for a specific market ID.
- **When to use:** When you have a specific Ticker ID and want to see the exact spread or cost for both sides.
